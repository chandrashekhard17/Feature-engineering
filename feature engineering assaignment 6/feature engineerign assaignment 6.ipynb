    "To address these questions effectively, let’s break them down into their respective calculations and interpretations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q1: Pearson Correlation Coefficient**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r)** is calculated using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ r = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{\\sigma_X \\sigma_Y} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- \\(\\text{Cov}(X, Y)\\) is the covariance of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\)\n",
    "- \\(\\sigma_X\\) is the standard deviation of \\(X\\)\n",
    "- \\(\\sigma_Y\\) is the standard deviation of \\(Y\\)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "1. **Calculate the mean of \\(X\\) (study time) and \\(Y\\) (exam scores).**\n",
    "2. **Calculate the covariance between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\).**\n",
    "3. **Calculate the standard deviations of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\).**\n",
    "4. **Plug these values into the formula.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- \\( r \\) ranges from -1 to 1.\n",
    "- \\( r = 1 \\) indicates a perfect positive linear relationship.\n",
    "- \\( r = -1 \\) indicates a perfect negative linear relationship.\n",
    "- \\( r = 0 \\) indicates no linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q2: Spearman's Rank Correlation**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spearman's Rank Correlation (ρ)** is calculated using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\rho = 1 - \\frac{6 \\sum d_i^2}{n(n^2 - 1)} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- \\(d_i\\) is the difference between the ranks of the \\(i\\)-th pair of values\n",
    "- \\(n\\) is the number of observations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "1. **Rank the values for both variables (sleep and job satisfaction).**\n",
    "2. **Calculate the differences in ranks (\\(d_i\\)).**\n",
    "3. **Square the differences (\\(d_i^2\\)).**\n",
    "4. **Sum the squared differences.**\n",
    "5. **Apply the formula.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- Similar to Pearson's correlation, ρ ranges from -1 to 1.\n",
    "- Positive ρ indicates a positive monotonic relationship.\n",
    "- Negative ρ indicates a negative monotonic relationship.\n",
    "- ρ close to 0 suggests a weak monotonic relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q3: Comparing Pearson and Spearman Correlations**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pearson Correlation Coefficient** measures the linear relationship between hours of exercise and BMI.\n",
    "- **Spearman's Rank Correlation** measures the monotonic relationship between these variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "1. **Perform the calculations as described in Q1 and Q2 for the exercise and BMI data.**\n",
    "2. **Compare the results.** If both correlations are similar, the relationship is likely linear and monotonic. If they differ significantly, the relationship might be non-linear but monotonic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q4: Pearson Correlation Coefficient**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "1. **Calculate the means, covariance, and standard deviations for hours of TV watching and physical activity.**\n",
    "2. **Apply the Pearson correlation formula.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- A positive correlation would indicate that more time spent watching TV is associated with less physical activity, and vice versa.\n",
    "- A negative correlation would suggest that more TV time is associated with more physical activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q5: Age and Brand Preference**\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate a correlation, you need numerical data. If age and brand preference are categorical (e.g., brand preference is not numerically coded), you might use a different approach, like chi-square tests or encoding categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q6: Pearson Correlation Coefficient for Sales Calls and Sales Made**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "1. **Calculate the means, covariance, and standard deviations for sales calls and sales made.**\n",
    "2. **Apply the Pearson correlation formula.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- A positive correlation indicates that more calls are associated with more sales.\n",
    "- A negative correlation would indicate that more calls are associated with fewer sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** For exact calculations, you would need specific datasets. If you provide sample data for any of these questions, I can help with the exact calculations."
